/// A protocol representing a node within the navigation graph.
///
/// Each node in a navigation graph represents a destination or screen in your application's flow.
/// Nodes are connected by edges that define how users can navigate between them.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// A `NavNode` defines two important associated types:
/// - `InputType`: The data required to present this destination
/// - `OutputType`: The data produced when the user completes interaction with this screen
///
/// For screens that don't require input or produce output, use `Void` for these types.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// final class WelcomeNode: NavNode {
///     typealias InputType = Void
///     typealias OutputType = WelcomeResult
///     
///     enum WelcomeResult {
///         case next
///         case signIn
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Identity
///
/// Each node must provide a unique identifier via the `id` property. Two nodes with the same
/// identifier are considered identical within a single navigation graph.
///
/// - Note: The default implementation generates an ID based on the class name.
public protocol NavNode: AnyObject {
    /// The type of data required to instantiate or present this destination.
    ///
    /// Use `Void` if the screen requires no input data.
    associatedtype InputType
    
    /// The type of data produced by this node upon completion.
    ///
    /// Use `Void` if the screen produces no output data.
    associatedtype OutputType
    
    /// A unique identifier for the node.
    ///
    /// Two nodes with the same identifier are considered identical within the context of a
    /// single navigation graph.
    var id: String { get }
}

/// A type-erased wrapper for `NavNode` instances.
///
/// `AnyNavNode` enables storing nodes with different generic types in the same collection.
/// It preserves the node's identity and provides access to subgraph information when applicable.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The navigation graph uses `AnyNavNode` internally to store heterogeneous node types
/// in a single adjacency map. This type erasure is essential for the graph's flexibility
/// while maintaining type safety at the edge level.
///
/// ## Subgraph Support
///
/// If a node represents a nested subgraph, the `subgraphWrapper` property provides
/// access to the internal graph structure without requiring type casting.
final class AnyNavNode {

    /// The node's unique identifier.
    let id: String
    
    /// The wrapped node instance.
    ///
    /// This property preserves the original node for identity comparison.
    /// - Warning: Do not use this property directly. Use the type-safe APIs instead.
    let wrappedNode: Any

    /// details for nodes that represent nested navigation flows.
