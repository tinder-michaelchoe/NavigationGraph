/// A protocol representing a node within the navigation graph.  Each
/// node has an associated `InputType` which describes the type of
/// information passed into that screen when it is navigated to, and
/// an associated `OutputType` which describes the type of data that
/// the node produces when it completes.  For screens that do not require
/// input or produce output, use `Void` for these associated types.
/// Conforming types must provide a unique `id` that identifies them
/// within the graph.
